	<h3 class="w3-wide">Welcome to Cwmaman Music Festival!</h3>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">Summer in the UK means festivals, so welcome to Cwmaman Music Festival, our annual music festival bringing you a weekend of musical excellence.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">Cwmaman Music Festival is held over three days on the last full weekend in September, and focuses primarily on artists and bands from the local music scene. The festival was formed for the benefit of people of all ages who enjoy live music, and to promote Cwmaman and the surrounding areas.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">Looking through the very busy programme of events, this year does not disappoint. Cwmaman Music Festival provides five venues, The Globe Inn, The Shepherds Arms, The Top Club, The Falcon Retreat, and The Bonki, and a Family Fun Drum Workshop at Cwmaman Arts Centre. We work closely with these venues and value their support for the festival. </p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">These venues will be hosting acts from many genres, and when you hear the name Cwmaman Music Festival you know you will be spoilt for choice with its musical diversity.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">This is a festival with a history of introducing signed and unsigned artists, bands, past acts include: Alabama 3, Madassa Soul Band, Attack Attack, Killing for Company, Shovelface, Bankrupt Pug, and Celtic Spirit. Many of them local acts, however some travelling vast distances to play this festival.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">Cwmaman Music Festival is an annual festival organised by a small group of people with a passion for music and is a community based and non-profit organisation. The festival has also always been equally dependent on sponsorship from local businesses, outside grants, and much volunteer work and local goodwill - this is good for us, it keeps us very connected with our audience, the community. We the Cwmaman Music Festival committee would like to pay many thanks to the local businesses who continue to sponsor and the people who support the festival.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="w3-justify">Thank you for your support, enjoy the festival and stay safe.</p>
