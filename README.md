# Cwmfest
Cwmfest static site / web app

I created the existing Cwmfest Wordpress site (cwmfest.co.uk) several years ago, and other than security updates, it's pretty much stayed as it is, with just the annual additions. The site is slower than it could be, and isn't great on mobile.

I want to learn more about creating websites, and maybe web apps, so this is the perfect opportunity. 

Sept 16th 2022 - Moved the repo to the festival's GitHub page to enable collaboration in the future
